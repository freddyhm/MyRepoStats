# **Application Framework Decision**

## Date

09/09/2023

## **Status**

Accepted

## **Context**

We need to decide which back-end javascript framework to use to supply our application with common functionalities like routing, request management, middleware, etc.

## **Decision**

Given our focus is on getting hands-on experience with the language, any framework will do. We will go with the most widely used which is Express.js given our quick research.

## Alternatives

- Nest.js
- Koa.js
- Meteor.js
- Sails.js

## Risks

Our application may be best built with a more lightweight framework. It may be easier to use as well.

## **Consequences**

Our application may be bloated from the start but we should have rich documentation to quickly build something.
