# **Application Framework Decision**

## Date

09/11/2023

## **Status**

Accepted

## **Context**

We need to reduce scope in order to have enough time to test different programming languages.

## **Decision**

The following areas will **not** be addressed in this app:

- Observability & Monitoring
- Security (outside of basic practices)
- Infrastructure-As-Code

## Alternatives

- Implement everything standard for an enterprise app

## Risks

Will not get the full picture of the ecosystem or day-to-day experience with the language

## **Consequences**

Unfairly evaluate the experience, but have more time to evaluate other languages
